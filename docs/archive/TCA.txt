Professional Execution Cost & TCA Information Sheet

(For strategy evaluation, backtest cost assimilation, and live execution benchmarking)

1) Core Definitions

Transaction Cost Analysis (TCA)

Systematic evaluation of trade execution costs vs market benchmarks.

Includes explicit and implicit costs.

Explicit Costs

Commissions, broker fees, exchange fees.

Implicit Costs

Slippage (executed price vs intended price)

Spread cost (bid-ask cost)

Market impact (trade moves market)

Timing/Opportunity cost (delay between signal and execution)

Benchmarks

Arrival Price: price at decision/submit time.

VWAP: volume-weighted average executed price.

TWAP: time-weighted average price.

Implementation Shortfall: realized cost vs theoretical trade price.

2) Institutional & Pro Trader Cost Framework

Pre-Trade Analysis

Estimate expected cost outcomes before executing using historical cost data.

Post-Trade Analysis

Compare executed trade to benchmarks to measure slippage and inefficiencies.

Market Impact Modeling

Larger orders relative to liquidity → higher implicit costs.

Slippage Decomposition (Buy-Side Practice)

Delay cost

Market impact cost

Opportunity cost

Reversion cost

3) How Pro Traders Calculate Net Trade Outcome

Entry / Exit Slippage

slippage = executed_price − benchmark_price


Benchmark: arrival, VWAP or other chosen.

Net PnL

net_pnl = (exit_fill − entry_fill) * contract_value − explicit_costs − implicit_costs


Cost as R formula (professional)

R_net = net_pnl / (stop_distance * point_value * contracts)


Stop distance must reflect actual risk at trade. (institutional net outcome)

4) Components Institutions Report On
Metric	What It Captures
Slippage to Arrival	Execution vs theoretical trade price at signal.
Execution vs VWAP	Execution efficiency relative to average volume price.
Latency	Time delay between signal and execution (ms).
Fill Ratio / Rejection Rate	Liquidity reliability measure.
Market Impact	Price movement caused by the order itself.
5) Why Flat Cost Assumptions Fall Short

A fixed R cost masks dependency on stop size, liquidity, volatility.

Professional TCA splits cost into components rather than 1 flat number.

6) Execution Cost Modeling Logic

Institutional TCA Model Template

total_costs = commissions + fees
            + slippage (arrival benchmark)
            + market_impact
            + timing_cost
            + opportunity_cost


Benchmark choice defines what slippage means.

7) Practical Output Requirements (for Claude Code)

Recommended logging fields per trade:

Signal timestamp & price (arrival)

Execution entry & exit prices with timestamps

Contract count / instrument / point value

Stop distance (R definition)

Commission / Fee data per leg

Slippage at entry and at exit

Benchmark reference (Arrival, VWAP, TWAP)

Market impact measure

Net R output

Use these to compute:

net_R, cost_as_R, expected vs realized cost distributions

8) Standard Quantitative Outputs

Expected distributions the system should compute for strategy evaluation:

Mean cost per trade (bps or R)

Slippage distribution (mean, stdev)

Benchmark vs execution deviation

Cost breakdown by component

Cost versus stop size buckets
(Used to refine realistic cost assumptions)

9) Why This Matters For Your Project

Ensures you aren’t using flat cost assumptions only.

Positions your strategy evaluation closer to institutional reality.

Allows true net R calculation rather than theoretical edge.

Usage Notes for Claude Code

Benchmark definitions must be explicit in output labels.

Execution slippage must be referenced to arrival price or VWAP/TWAP.

Output must classify costs by type (explicit, implicitly broken down).
