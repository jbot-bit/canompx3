## Working preferences

- User prefers practical, frequent edges over rare setups.
- Approximate acceptance benchmark: target ~150 usable signals/year if edge quality is strong.
- Prioritize finding robust "common ground" shinies before pursuing sparse niche signals.
- Baseline-positive alone is not considered usable; candidates must show clear filtered uplift and practical tradability.
- User dislikes low-threshold candidate filtering (e.g., avg_on ~0.08 / uplift ~0.18) for deployment decisions; prioritize A-tier gain gates.
