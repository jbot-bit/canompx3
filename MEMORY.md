## Working preferences

- User prefers practical, frequent edges over rare setups.
- Approximate acceptance benchmark: target ~150 usable signals/year if edge quality is strong.
- Prioritize finding robust "common ground" shinies before pursuing sparse niche signals.
- Baseline-positive alone is not considered usable; candidates must show clear filtered uplift and practical tradability.
- User dislikes low-threshold candidate filtering (e.g., avg_on ~0.08 / uplift ~0.18) for deployment decisions; prioritize A-tier gain gates.
- User explicitly rejects trailing DD accounts ("can't breathe"). Static DD preferred.
- User gets frustrated with verbose/slow responses — keep tight and actionable.
- User wants MORE validated edges, not just refinement of existing ones.

## Prop Firm Decision
- **Apex Trader Funding Static 100K** ($297/month, $625 hard DD, Tradovate)
- Phase-in plan: A0 only first → Gold slots → full schedule as buffer builds
- PROP_PLAYS.md contains the definitive manual trading plan
- Trailing accounts rejected by user. Static wins long-term as buffer compounds.

## New Validated / Confirmed Signals (2026-02-24)
- **H3 Volume impulse**: High rel_vol at break bar (top 20%) = +5-8.5% WR uplift, 6/6+ year consistency. Overlay for all slots.
- **R2 PDH/PDL before 10am**: M2K +14.9%, MGC +8.5%, MES +5.5% uplift on 10am ORB. Pre-trade, no look-ahead. Clean.
- **A0x (asymmetry variant)**: WATCH status, 2025 OOS uplift +0.757. Next strict validation priority.
- **VWAP/mean reversion**: Confirmed dead. Do not pursue.
- **B1**: Confirmed KILL despite exciting forward gate (n=7 = noise; failed strict WF).
- **Look-ahead bias lesson**: day_type TREND_UP/DOWN showed fake 10-19% uplifts. Day's realized structure ≠ pre-trade signal.
