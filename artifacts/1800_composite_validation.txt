--- HONEST ASSESSMENT ---

  STRENGTHS:
    + High per-R expectancy (+0.51R)
    + Cash register leg (RR1.0) has 75.0% WR
    + Survives 7.8x friction stress test
    + Profit factor 2.93

  WEAKNESSES:
    - Only 40 trades -- REGIME classification, not CORE
    - 76% of PnL concentrated in 2025-2026
    - Only 1.5 trades/year before 2024 -- thin history

  RISKS:
    - 15m AGREE is a new filter concept not in the validated grid
    - Split targets double contract count (execution complexity)
    - ORB regime shift could eliminate G6+ opportunities

  UNKNOWNS:
    - Fill-bar exit granularity (R1) not yet applied to orb_outcomes
    - 2016-2020 outcomes not built -- would extend backtest history
    - Volume filter interaction not tested
