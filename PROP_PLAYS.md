## Why Static
Floor never moves. Every dollar you earn makes the account safer.
Trailing accounts keep the danger zone at your heels forever. Static doesn't.

---

## Phase 1 — Survive (buffer $0 → $1,000)
**Trade A0 only. 1 MES micro.**

- 1 loss = $49. Worst realistic streak (10 losses) = $490. Stays inside $625.
- Realistic income: ~$80-100/month
- Goal: build $1,000 buffer before adding anything

**A0 trade:** MES_US_EQUITY_OPEN | 12:30am Brisbane | RR 1.5 | Filter: ORB_G5

## Phase 2 — Build ($1,000 → $3,000)
**Add Gold slots. Still 1 micro each.**

| Time (BRIS) | Slot | RR | $/R |
|---|---|---|---|
| 12:30am | MES_US_EQUITY_OPEN (A0) | 1.5 | $49 |
| 9:00am | MGC_1800 | 2.0 | $72 |
| 12:00am | MGC_0900 | 2.5 | $74 |

- Realistic income: ~$250/month
- Goal: $3,000 buffer

## Phase 3 — Full Manual Schedule ($3,000+)
**Add remaining slots. Floor is $625 and immovable. Account is safe.**

Add in order of ExpR:
1. MGC_1000 (1:00am, RR 2.0)
2. MNQ_1100 (2:00am, RR 2.0)
3. MNQ_0030 (11:30am, RR 2.0)
4. MES_CME_CLOSE (3:00am, RR 1.0)
5. MNQ_CME_OPEN (11:30pm, RR 1.0)

Full schedule income: ~$460/month. Floor still $625. Buffer $3,625+.

---

## Stop Rules
- Down 3 losses in a day → stop for the day
- Buffer drops below $300 → A0 only until recovered
- Buffer hits $0 → stop, review

---

## Eval Strategy
Profit target = $2,000. At Phase 2 pace (~$250/mo) = ~8 months.
To go faster: trade Phase 2 slots from day 1 in eval (you're not risking real money, just need to stay above $625 floor). Could hit $2K in 3-4 months.

---

## Consistency Rule (payout)
Biggest single trade (MGC_0900 at 2.5R): $185 → need $617 total profit before payout.
Not a problem — by the time you're requesting a payout you'll have well over that.
