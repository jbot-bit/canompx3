# HANDOFF.md — Cross-Tool Session Baton

**Rule:** If you made decisions, changed files, or left work half-done — update the baton.

**CRITICAL:** Do NOT implement code changes based on stale assumptions. Always `git log --oneline -10` and re-read modified files before writing code.

**Compact baton only:** Durable decisions live in `docs/runtime/decision-ledger.md`, design history lives in `docs/plans/`, and archived session detail lives in `docs/handoffs/archived/`.

## Last Session
- **Tool:** Claude Code
- **Date:** 2026-04-27
- **Commit:** 9a51a45d — chore(handoff): sync last-session header to 45b67617
- **Files changed:** 1 files
  - `HANDOFF.md`

## Session decisions (2026-04-27 — orphan-branch recovery)

- **Recovered 4 negative-result research notes from `codex/ev-roi-4r-hunt`** (originals: `ea9a2818`, `7205b63e`, `428cda03`, `34e17aad`). Code from that branch (F5_BELOW_PDL filter, prereg, hunt harness) landed via PR #116 then was killed by one-shot Mode A IS/OOS validator (`90a815dd`, "OOS direction flip on sacred window"). The 4 docs document the WHY behind the kill and the post-kill routing decisions — preserved here so the NO-GO is discoverable. Branched from `origin/main` as `recover/ev-roi-4r-docs`. Original 4 commits dropped (HANDOFF.md noise only outside the 4 doc files).
- **`codex/ev-roi-4r-hunt` branch retained locally** for now — the 5th non-doc commit (`80bda59c research(discovery): lock mnq below-pdl frontier prereg`) is also in main as part of the F5 work landed via PR #116. Branch can be deleted once recovery PR is merged.

## Session decisions (2026-04-27 — token-hygiene automation, uncommitted)

- **Valid isolated worktree used** — token/context-efficiency work lives in `/tmp/canompx3-token-audit-v2` on branch `wt-codex-token-audit-v2`. Earlier `.worktrees/tasks/codex/token-audit` path was orphaned; do not rely on it.
- **Cheap-default / high-rigor policy built in** — `.claude/settings.json` now defaults to `effortLevel: medium`, `alwaysThinkingEnabled: false`, and no default experimental agent teams. New `UserPromptSubmit` hook `risk-tier-guard.py` injects a short escalation hint only for `high`/`critical` prompts; low-risk prompts get nothing.
- **Startup/context noise trimmed** — `stage-awareness.py` now caps prompt-stage previews and `claude_superpower_brief.py` no longer dumps memory chatter on session start. Always-on rules remain limited to `workflow-preferences.md` and `auto-skill-routing.md`, both shortened.
- **Private startup context moved out of gitignored repo-root dependency** — repo docs now treat `SOUL.md`, `USER.md`, and `memory/*.md` as optional legacy notes rather than required startup context for worktrees. User-level Claude memory created at `/mnt/c/Users/joshd/.claude/CLAUDE.md` with small imported canompx3-specific note `/mnt/c/Users/joshd/.claude/canompx3-personal.md`.
- **Operational inspection surface added** — `scripts/tools/token_hygiene_report.py` reports measured startup-doc sizes, always-on vs path-scoped rules, stage-file count, reasoning defaults, agent-team status, and whether user-level Claude memory exists. Shared playbook added at `docs/reference/claude-token-hygiene.md`; startup docs now point to both.
- **Measured state after changes** — report in the isolated worktree shows `effortLevel: medium`, `alwaysThinkingEnabled: False`, agent teams off, risk-tier hook present, only 2 always-on rules, 2 active stage files, and user-level Claude memory detected. `python3 -m py_compile` passed for `risk-tier-guard.py`, `stage-awareness.py`, `claude_superpower_brief.py`, and `token_hygiene_report.py`.
- **Explicit remaining gap** — no live Claude UI session was run to verify `/context` deltas or hook behavior end-to-end inside Claude Code. Integration is verified syntactically and behaviorally via direct script execution only.
- **Environment warning** — manual `python3 scripts/tools/session_preflight.py --context codex-wsl` from this isolated worktree failed with `ModuleNotFoundError: pydantic`, indicating this checkout currently lacks the expected Python deps / `.venv-wsl` availability for full preflight.

## Session decisions (2026-04-27 — PR #124 re-extraction + cleanup)

- **PR #147 merged (170b6085)** — re-extract of abandoned PR #124 onto fresh main. Original PR #124 (`chore/pass-three-drift`, commit `6c279810`) was based on `cebefd92` (pre-PR-#126 + pre-PR-#130-renormalization); CI failed on the wall-clock-time-bomb test fix landed by PR #126, and local rebase developed 4 production-code conflicts (`pipeline/check_drift.py`, `trading_app/live/alert_engine.py`, `trading_app/live/webhook_server.py`, `tests/test_pipeline/test_work_queue.py`) plus 79 CRLF-only files from missing PR #130 renormalization on its base. PR #124 closed with cross-link.
- **Drift check #120 live** — `check_magic_number_rationale(trading_app_dir)` AST-walks `trading_app/live/` for UPPER_SNAKE_CASE numeric constants `abs(value) > 10` and requires `Rationale:` / `rationale` (case-insensitive) within ±10 lines OR membership in `RATIONALE_WHITELIST` (initially empty). Cites Robert Carver, *Systematic Trading*, Ch. 4 (parameter-justification discipline). 9 existing constants retagged to satisfy.
- **Criterion 11 / 12 control state refresh** — both `valid=False reason=db identity mismatch` cleared via `python scripts/tools/refresh_control_state.py --profile topstep_50k_mnq_auto`. C11 now operational 83.1% / age=0d / paths=10000; C12 5 CONTINUE / 1 ALARM (L4 NYSE_OPEN COST_LT12 SR=33.27 vs threshold=31.96 — pre-existing, expected blocked-lane state).
- **Worktree + branch cleanup** — `canompx3-pt` worktree force-removed (held 79 CRLF-only files + 1 stale HANDOFF auto-update stub, no real WIP); `canompx3-pr124` temp worktree removed after PR #147 merge; local branches `chore/pass-three-drift{,-v2}` deleted; remote branches `chore/pass-three-drift{,-v2}` deleted on origin. 3 obsolete stashes dropped (PR #124 cleanup wash, PR #138 mutex already-landed, PR #135 pre-merge HANDOFF state).
- **PR #99 (Codex DRAFT) standing-instruction acknowledgment** — DEFERRED. Hook treated retry as duplicate-attempt. Standing instruction in HANDOFF still holds: leave for Codex.

## Session decisions (2026-04-26 evening + late-evening sweep)

- **Env hardening landed** (PR #136, merged) — venv pinned to `uv.lock`, `_env_drift_lines()` reports drift at session-start, `requirements.txt` regenerated from lock.
- **Same-worktree mutex landed** (PR #138, merged `e306284b`) — atomic `O_EXCL` lock at `<git-dir>/.claude.pid` prevents two Claudes in one worktree (closes the `cannot lock ref 'HEAD'` race). 4 scenarios tested.
- **Architecture decision: per-session clones REJECTED.** Researched against 2026 industry consensus (Anthropic, Augment Code, Penligent, Upsun) — worktrees + runtime isolation is the recommended pattern. `_discover_git_common_root()` in `pipeline/paths.py:33-65` already implements canonical worktree-shared-DB.
- **Phase 1B / 1C DEFERRED** — cross-worktree push lock and runtime isolation audit, both low-priority/advisory. Not blocking.
- **Hook-output trim DEFERRED** — needs production-code edits to `scripts/tools/task_route_packet.py`; properly stage-gated.
- **Recovery PRs #133/#134 CLOSED** — stash content already preserved at `archive/stash-2026-04-26-l1-europe-flow-pr1a-v2` and `archive/stash-2026-04-26-l6-wip-pre-correction`. PRs closed with archive-tag citations; `recover/l1-europe-flow-prereg` and `recover/l6-us-data-2026-diagnostic` deleted local + remote.
- **Evidence-auditor obligation discharged** — the stage `open-pr-review-debt.md` listed 7 deferred PRs. As of 2026-04-26: #72/#74/#59/#8 CLOSED, #12 MERGED, #36 CLOSED (re-extracted as PR #135 which MERGED). #99 remains DRAFT (Codex). All 6 non-DRAFT entries resolved historically without auditor pass — recorded as discharged, not pending.
- **Conservative zombie sweep** — deleted 4 `[gone]`-flagged local branches (`chore/handover-2026-04-26-pr125-126`, `ralph/burndown-v5.3-rebased`, `ralph/crit-high-burndown-v5.3-high-tier`, `research/pr48-sizer-rule-oos-backtest`). `ralph/crit-high-burndown-v5.2` retained because `canompx3-ralph-burndown` worktree still uses it.

## Active stages (1 remaining)

1. **`pr48-mgc-shadow-only-overlay-contract.md`** (IMPLEMENTATION) — operator observation pending; do not action without observation result.

## Next Steps — Active

1. **PR #99** (DRAFT, Codex's `wt-codex-mnq-hiroi-scan`) — research(mnq) MNQ COMEX geometry hardening + COMEX family stamp. Standing instruction: comment + leave for Codex.

2. **Action queue** — fully closed as of 2026-04-26. `cross_asset_session_chronology_spec` marked CLOSED (spec frozen at `docs/plans/2026-04-25-cross-asset-session-chronology-spec.md` via PR #101 / `87ebc885`); re-opens when a future cross-asset prereg explicitly cites and gates on it. No P1 ready items remain.

3. **Operator action** — MGC shadow observation; result unblocks `mes_q45_exec_bridge` action-queue item.

## Parallel session activity (DO NOT TOUCH)

- **`canompx3`** — `chore/brain-skill` (orphan branch with merged-content commits + ralph-loop session committing here). Ralph terminal active 2026-04-27 — do not write to this worktree.
- **`canompx3-ralph-burndown`** — `ralph/crit-high-burndown-v5.2` (branch `[gone]` on remote; HEAD `6740d938` predates merged Ralph PRs #107/#110). Stale; do not write to it. Local branch retained because of this worktree.
- **`canompx3-ghost`** — checked out on `main` (this handoff PR's worktree); idle after this session.
- **`canompx3-pt`** — REMOVED 2026-04-27 after PR #124 closed.
- **MGC shadow observation** — operator action; observation result unblocks `mes_q45_exec_bridge` action-queue item.

## Blockers / Warnings

- Memory entries calling F-1 "dormant" are FACTUALLY WRONG — F-1 is **active** and fail-closing in signal-only. Day-1 XFA seeds `_topstep_xfa_eod_balance = $0.0` (canonical per `topstep_scaling_plan.py:51-53`); 6 deployed MNQ lanes ALLOW through `risk_mgr.can_enter()`. Verified empirically (E2E probe in PR #100/B6 work).
- `build_live_portfolio()` is **DEPRECATED** — `--all --signal-only` without `--profile` hard-fails all 3 orchestrators. Only `--profile` path works.
- Drift checks pre-existing: #4 (`work_queue.py` schema parser false-positive on `table 'the'`) and #59 (MGC — 1 day with `!= 3 daily_features` rows). Neither blocking.
- Working-tree debt: `requirements.txt` regenerated by `uv export` may be dirty in `canompx3-ghost` (main) worktree. Separate concern; needs its own commit + uv-lock-vs-export reconciliation.
- ~53 zombie local branches remain after 2026-04-26 conservative sweep (4 deleted). Most have merged PRs but no `[gone]` flag because origin still hosts the branch. Aggressive sweep deferred — would benefit from `clean_gone` command + cross-reference of `git branch --list` against `gh pr list --state all`.
